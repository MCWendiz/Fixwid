## Coding Guidelines

### C# Style

- Follow standard C# naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs
- Keep methods focused and small

### Code Organization

- Place models in `Models/` folder
- Place services in `Services/` folder
- Keep UI logic in code-behind files
- Use async/await for I/O operations

### Comments

- Write clear, concise comments
- Explain *why*, not *what*
- Use XML documentation for public APIs
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

## Testing

- Test on different Windows versions (10, 11)
- Test with various screen resolutions
- Test with different widget URLs
- Test edge cases (invalid JSON, network errors, etc.)

## Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant

Examples:
```
Add support for custom window shapes
Fix crash when ntfy connection drops
Update README with new configuration options
```
